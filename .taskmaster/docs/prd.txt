# PRD: Enhance Neo4j Tooling for Gitingest

## Overview
Improve developer experience for visualising a repository's file/function call graph in Neo4j. Provide better documentation and stronger validation scripts.

## Functional Requirements
1. **Neo4j README**
   - Deliver a detailed `neo4j/README.md` with setup, workflow, script explanations, troubleshooting.
2. **Schema-aware Health-check**
   - Extend `neo4j/check_neo4j.sh` with STRICT mode that:
     - Fails when node/relationship counts are zero.
     - Verifies expected node labels (`Entity`) and relationship types (`CONTAINS`, `CALLS`, `INHERITS`).
     - Allows overrides via `EXPECTED_LABELS` and `EXPECTED_REL_TYPES` environment variables.
3. **README Update**
   - Document the new STRICT mode usage and environment overrides.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Scripts must be bash-compatible and CI-friendly (exit non-zero on failure).
- Documentation should be concise but comprehensive.

## Deliverables
- `neo4j/README.md`
- Updated `neo4j/check_neo4j.sh`
- Updated documentation snippets in README.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Running the documented workflow loads data; `check_neo4j.sh` passes in STRICT mode.
- Misconfigured EXPECTED_* vars cause the script to fail as expected.
